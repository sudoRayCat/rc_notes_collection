Devices running embedded Linux can be vulnerable to boot interruption if the hardware setup allows. If the system has a two stage boot process that reside in separate memory locations (can use [[Information Gathering#FCC-ID|FCC]] to get internal view) the Linux boot may be interrupted. This can leave a terminal which commands can be entered in.
